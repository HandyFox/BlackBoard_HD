'A high definition blackboard that allows you to easily manage your students grades'

BlackBoard HD is designed to easily manage students grades and get quick acurate results. In making it I tried to tread the fine line between simplicity and sufficient data. But I am not a teacher so if you have any questions or comments for future releases please email me.
History

My original intent with this piece of software was to create a suite of handy tools... something you use all the time.... a BLACKBOARD. Although it is not a complete suite of tools at the present the name still stuck. If you have any handy features you want to see included just let me know and I will attempt to add them to future realeses.

This project is free and always will be.

If you like it you can always support by making a donation.
