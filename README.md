Introduction

'A high definition blackboard that allows you to easily manage your students grades'

BlackBoard HD is designed to easily manage students grades and get quick acurate results. In making it I tried to tread the fine line between simplicity and sufficient data. But I am not a teacher so if you have any questions or comments for future releases please email me.
History

My original intent with this piece of software was to create a suite of handy tools... something you use all the time.... a BLACKBOARD. Although it is not a complete suite of tools at the present the name still stuck. If you have any handy features you want to see included just let me know and I will attempt to add them to future realeses.
